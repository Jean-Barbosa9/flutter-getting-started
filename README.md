## Notes

### About my understandings by reading the documatation

 - A Stateful Widget is needed to instatiate the State Widget. It's immutable, so all values are final and it'll be used as a "variable" into rendering, expecting all its values and returns through the State Widget;
 - final it's a type of value which define the Stateful Widget values;
 - A State Widget holds all the app logic and change the app values, like add or remove items in a list, increment or decrement numbers, etc. It needs a build method that works similar to constructor method in React class based components;
 - Arrow notation is used in one line functions;
 - Using underscore as prefix of a identifier, reforce it's privace into a State Widget;
